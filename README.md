# SamD21SystemTImerExample
Timer Control System Timer for the SAMD21 

This tutorial will show you how to implement a Stop Watch Timer Controller. This tutorial is based off the Atmel’s LWMesh Peer2Peer Application for the SAMR21 xplained pro. While working on the example project, there was a System Software Timer routine that I wanted to implemented on other projects and boards.

This code works like a stop watch. You can start and stop the timer as needed. This can be very useful measuring timeouts. I recently worked on a LWMesh project with 2 SAMR21 Xplained Pro boards. The SAMR21 is a Radio Tranceivers The project consisted of sending large amounts of data from one board to the next via RF. I implemented a timeout to let the sender know that the receiver never received all the data.

In you are familiar with the Atmel Software Foundation (ASF), you will realize that ASF provides a lot of examples for working with their AVR and SAM 32-bit ARM® Cortex®-M0+ processors. However, implement these example projects in another project can be daunting and time consuming. This tutorial takes the leg work out of implementing a Stop Watch timer controller and adding it any SAMD21 project.
